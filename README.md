# RestingState

This repository contains a resting state (RS) paradigm task implemented in [jsPsych]() that can be run from the browser:

- [https://realitybending.github.io/restingstate/](https://realitybending.github.io/RestingState/)

## Installation

**No installation required!** You can either download the whole repository and open `experiment/restingstate.html` in your browser or run it directly in the internet using the following [**link**](https://realitybending.github.io/restingstate/).

## Features

- [x] Eyes closed (to minimize eyes-related artifacts for EEG)
- [x] 8 min
- [x] Post-resting state assessment

## Scientific Background

### Eyes-closed vs. Eyes-opened

- TODO: Review arguments in favour / against.


### Duration

- TODO: Arguments for given duration
- TODO: Study about HRV + EEG Complexity + EEG Frequency indices stability

### Post RS assessment

Some type of scale to assess subjective experiences and inner thoughts during resting EEG to potentially explore differences in types of self-generated thoughts and how they relate to whole brain measures of intrinsic brain activity

- [Amsterdam Resting State Questionnaire 2.0](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02533) (ARSQ)
  - 54 item scale

### Neuro-behavioural Associations

#### EEG Microstates

[Pipinis et al. (2016)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10548-016-0522-2) showed associations between **microstate B** and **Comfort**, and **microstate C** and **Somatic Awareness (SA)**.
